How to programming in MVVM pattern in SwiftUI, in another word, developers are recommended work in MVVM in SwiftUI by Apple.

## Codes

```swift

import SwiftUI

// - MARK: Model

struct Person {
    var id = UUID().uuidString
}

// - MARK: ViewModel

class ContentViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var person = Person()
}

// - MARK: View

struct ContentView: View {
    
    @StateObject var data = ContentViewModel()
    
    var body: some View {
        
        VStack {
            
            Button("Change Person's Name") {
                data.person = Person()
            }
            .padding()
            .background(Color.green)
            .foregroundColor(.white)
            
            Text("Person's ID: \(data.person.id)")
        }
    }
}

```

## Key Points

1. If you assign one struct to another, Swift copies it behind the scenes so that it is a complete, standalone duplicate of the original. Well, that's not strictly true: Swift uses a technique called "copy on write" which means it only actually copies your data if you try to change it. However, you can decorate a function with `mutate` so that you can change it without a copy, but it is not recommended at most of time. KEEP IT SIMPLE is the most important principle on your programming.
