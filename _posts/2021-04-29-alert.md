## Topics

Use an alert when you want the user to act in response to the state of the app or the system. If you want the user to make a choice in response to their own action, use an `ActionSheet` instead.

## Codes

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    
    @State var show = false
    
    var body: some View {
        
        Button("Show Alert") {
            
            show.toggle()
        }
        .padding()
        .background(Color.blue)
        .foregroundColor(.white)
        .alert(isPresented: $show, content: {
            
            Alert(title: Text("App Message"), message: Text("Good Job!"), dismissButton: .cancel())
        })
    }
}
```

## Key Points

1. Don't need disappear an alert manually, I mean, you never set `show` to `nil` manually in this case, because `Alert` will do that when user select one item or cancel the action sheet.
1. Never use `alert` multiple times in a same scene, I mean, only one `alert` will work no matter how many `alert` you wrote.
